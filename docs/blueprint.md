## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong, saturated blue (#3F51B5) for a trustworthy, yet modern feel. Blue relates to the 'Smart' part of the app, but the saturation stops it from being corporate. Analogous to the initial page.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E8EAF6) creating a calming and clean environment.
- Accent color: Purple (#7E57C2) to highlight important actions and elements, providing visual interest and reflecting a modern aesthetic.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' sans-serif, to emphasize the forward thinking design. Body font: 'PT Sans' sans-serif, to emphasize readability throughout the app.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent grocery items, pantry management, and meal planning features.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout for displaying items, recipes, and suggestions. Prioritize whitespace for a clutter-free UI.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions, like adding items to the cart or updating quantities.
